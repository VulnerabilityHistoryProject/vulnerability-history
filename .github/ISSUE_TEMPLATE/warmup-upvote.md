To get to know the project, I'd like you to peruse the site and learn about some vulnerabilities. I'm giving you 50 "upvotes", and I want you to distribute them amongst 5 vulnerabilities. Those 5 vulnerabilities must currently have less than 10 upvotes, but at least 1 upvote. (Zero-upvote vulnerabilities are likely to be uncurated) Choose those 5 at random by going to http://vulnerabilityhistory.org/vulnerabilities

Distribute those 50 upvotes however you like. If something is really fascinating, putting all 50 on one is fine. The only thing I _forbid_ is spreading 10 votes to each one - split hairs and decide which is most interesting to you. 

An upvote is a subjective measure of how interesting you find the vulnerability in general. It's the "squishy" factor we sort vulnerabilities by everywhere. 

Do the following:

- [ ] Take any UX notes for improvements in the future. Be ready to share at your next meeting
- [ ] Make a pull request for the corresponding YML increasing the upvotes
- [ ] Make any corrections or updates to the vulnerability YML that you see fit. Answer any unanswered questions. 
- [ ] Come up with a nickname for the vulnerability, if it doesn't already have one. Must be 30 characters or less, and try to make it clever.
