Add any other context about the problem here.

**Check the following:**

- [ ] I have checked the VHP backlog for something similar: https://github.com/VulnerabilityHistoryProject/vulnerability-history/issues
- [ ] I have checked if this should also be part of a Github Project: https://github.com/VulnerabilityHistoryProject/vulnerability-history/projects?type=beta
