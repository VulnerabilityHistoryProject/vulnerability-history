Tags are one of the main ways we use organize vulnerabilities in VHP.
Tags can be gathered automatically, or manually, or with a combination
of both. Here are a few different types of tags below.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>CWE</b>, or Common Weakness Enumeration, tags are manually assigned
by curators to describe the particular type of vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Lesson</b> tags are about broader lessons that can be learned from
that vulnerability. These are security principles and engineering
pitfalls that we believe should be taught to all software engineers.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Discovered</b> tags describe various classifications of about how
the vulnerability was originally found.
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Subsystem</b> tags are the curators' best efforts at determining
what part of the system this vulnerability affected.
