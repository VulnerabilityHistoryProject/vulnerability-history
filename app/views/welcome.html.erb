        <p>Loop counters, file sizes, malloc arguments, session tokens, primary keys.... numbers are everywhere in our code. When we're working with integers, what happens when that our numbers get very, very big?</p>

        <p>Integer overflow, or wraparound, is much more dangerous than it seems. Learn more about it and

        <p>Environment variables are great features for custom configuration, when handled properly. When gone wrong, environment variables allow for side-loading in malicious code, build file problems, and various other effects.</p>

        <p>Treat data from environment variables with respect. Learn more and see examples of vulnerabilities that involve environment variables.</p>

        <p>Bounty awards are when the development team awards a user for reporting a vulnerability. The more severe the problem, the bigger the reward.</p>

        <p>Random testing, also called fuzzing, is a widely-used technique for discovering bugs automatically. Fuzz testing programs will look for weaknesses by intelligently generating random inputs and executing the system repeatedly on those inputs.</p>

        <p>While quite useful for finding hard-to-reach bugs, fuzzing is only effective for finding certain kinds of vulnerabilities. See what kinds of vulnerabilities are found by fuzzers.</a>
