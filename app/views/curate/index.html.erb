    <h1>How To Curate</h1>
    <p> This project relies upon a massive effort to collect, correct, and
      annotate vulnerability history data. We call this process <b>curating</b>.
    </p>
    <p> Today, the majority of our curating comes from a class assignment in our
      upper-level required course, <em>Engineering Secure Software</em>. <a
        href="https://github.com/VulnerabilityHistoryProject/chromium-vulnerabilities/tree/dev/assignment">Example
        instructions of that assignment can be found here.</a> In the future we
      plan on adapting those instructions to a broader audience and putting
      step-by-step instructions in here.</p>

    <h2>Who should curate?</h2>
    <p>Anyone with <b>some programming experience</b> can curate a
      vulnerability. Our students in the software engineering program who
      typically curate these vulnerabilities are juniors and seniors. A
      vulnerability is just an engineering mistake, usually manifesting itself
      in code. So all you need to understand is code.</p>
    <p><i>You do not need to be security expert or hobbyist.</i> In fact,
      curation is a fantastic learning experience. So maybe curating a
      vulnerability if how you learn about your first vulnerability!</p>
    <p><i>You do not need to expert in the project.</i> You don't need to have
      written an entire browser to understand the basics of what happened in a
      specific, narrow situation.</p>

    <h2>Who should I write for?</h2>
    <p>Again, anyone <b>some programming experience</b>. You are writing to your
      peers, both junior and senior. You can assume that your audience knows the
      basics about programming, for example, technical words like "pointers" are
      okay. </p>
