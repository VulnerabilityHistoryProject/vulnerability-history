        <p>Well-meaning engineers labor hard to make their software both function and be secure. In the thousands of lines of code they write, test, document, and code review... they make <span class="color-green">one mistake...</span> and that's the one that ends up becoming famous.</p>

        <p>Is anyone taking a systematic look at the <span class="color-green">complex histories</span> behind vulnerabilities? In VHP, that's what we do.</p>
        <p>We dive deeper. We combine state-of-the-art automated repository mining techniques with crowd-sourced curations to collect rich histories of vulnerabilities. We're not about blaming, <span class="color-green">we're about learning.</span></p>

        <h2 class="color-green">A Story emerges</h2>
        <p>The vulnerability is the endpoint of a long journey. First we <span class="color-green">trace the vulnerability</span> to its source code fix. Then we <span class="color-green">mine the repository</span> to find the Vulnerability Contributing Commit (VCC). Then we automatically <span class="color-green">construct a timeline</span>, then tag. A curator then comes along and corrects the data, telling the broader story of the vulnerability.</p>
        <p>With this methodology, what appears to be a "simple coding mistake" becomes a <span class="color-green">unique narrative</span>. Reality is messy, tedious, and nuanced.</p>
        <p>Our philosophy is to always <span class="color-green">provide more context</span> and let the story tell itself</p>

        <p>This is not a dumping ground for CSVs. This is a well of data and analysis that can be revisited for decades to come.</p>
        <p>Projects such as the CVE and NVD aim to be comprehensive, but <span class="color-green">remain surface level</span>. We can learn through detailed systematic taxonomies and lessons through projects like CWE and OWASP, but differentiating what is possible from what is probable is difficult. Automated scanners liked Snyk can help get you started in fixing your existing problems, but ignore the <span class="color-green">socio-technical factors</span> behind the engineering process, leaving teams to continue to repeat their mistakes.</p>
        <p>We've noticed that very little is known or recorded about how a vulnerability came about and how it was missed. But, modern software engineering produce rich artifacts like <span class="color-green">Git repositories</span>, <span class="color-green">pull requests</span>, and <span class="color-green">bug databases</span> that are ripe for mining.</p>
        <p>Indeed, entire academic communities are devoted to understanding and improving <span class="color-green">engineering practice</span> through mining software repositories. We come from that community, but we also acknowledge that models and experiments are ephemeral. Data is forever.</p>
