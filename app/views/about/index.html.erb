    <h2>What Is This?</h2>
    <p>This is a non-profit, open source project devoted to educating the world
      about secure software engineering by understanding our history.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For students, it's a set of assignments and teaching materials</li>
      <li>For professionals, it's a museum from which we can learn</li>
      <li>For academics, it's a curated data set and an engine for generating
        new hypotheses and insights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>The main contact for this project is <a
        href="https://www.se.rit.edu/~andy">Andy Meneely</a>, who is an
      Associate Professor of Software Engineering at Rochester Institute of
      Technology.</p>
