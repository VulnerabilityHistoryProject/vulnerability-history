<h2>Using this Table</h2>
<p>Use this table to peruse the data pertaining that have had
vulnerability fixes before. Note that a file can also have multiple
fix commits for a single vulnerability.</p>

<p>As you can see, some files are "repeat offenders" as well, having
tons of vulnerabilities in their history. Some of these may not be
suprising - for example, dependency configuration files. File path
names can give you an informal search of the different subsystems and
features that are affected by vulnerabilities. </p>
