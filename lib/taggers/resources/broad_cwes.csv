16,"Configuration","Weaknesses in this category are typically introduced during the configuration of the software."
19,"Data Processing Errors","Weaknesses in this category are typically found in functionality that processes data."
189,"Numeric Errors","Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers."
254,"7PK - Security Features","Software security is not security software. Here we're concerned with topics like authentication, access control, confidentiality, cryptography, and privilege management."
264,"Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
265,"Privilege / Sandbox Issues","Weaknesses in this category occur with improper enforcement of sandbox environments, or the improper handling, assignment, or management of privileges."
310,"Cryptographic Issues","Weaknesses in this category are related to the use of cryptography."
361,"7PK - Time and State","This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses related to the improper management of time and state in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems, processes, or threads. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, ""Distributed computation is about time and state. That is, in order for more than one component to communicate, state must be shared, and all that takes time. Most programmers anthropomorphize their work. They think about one thread of control carrying out the entire program in the same way they would if they had to do the job themselves. Modern computers, however, switch between tasks very quickly, and in multi-core, multi-CPU, or distributed systems, two events may take place at exactly the same time. Defects rush to fill the gap between the programmer's model of how a program executes and what happens in reality. These defects are related to unexpected interactions between threads, processes, time, and information. These interactions happen through shared state: semaphores, variables, the file system, and, basically, anything that can store information."""
399,"Resource Management Errors","Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources."
