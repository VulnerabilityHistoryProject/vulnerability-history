      Articles are difficult to write. How do I know that?
      Well, I'm having difficulty trying to come up with 
      stuff for this.

    title: Why Fixtures are Important

    blurb: More fixtures are helpful in the long run.
    fulltext: |
      Fixtures are ways in which rails allows for sample data to be tested. 
      Although there likely won't be as many fixtures as what's actually in a database,
      it's probably good practice to keep a few of these around so as to not make 
      test pages bland, firstly, and secondly to ensure proper behavior on more than 
      just one article, for instance.

    blurb: |
      This is another fixture to 
      see if it shows up on the home page.

      But this one tests how multi-line
      behavior is.

      I agree with Marianna. Articles are hard to write, especially when they 
      are bogus test articles that don't mean anything, and aren't about anything.

    blurb: Especially when the article count gets longer.

      Studies show, the more test articles you write, the harder it becomes to find 
      new things to say, especially when nobody but the testers will see it.

    blurb: The last one I make, system tests default to using Rake.

      It's my mission to rhyme on this last of tests, I know it's time to 
      try my best. I'll only make three tries, and then I'll cut my ties. This 
      is my attempt to make testing articles fun, and not make me want to run.

article6:

    title: Something Else

    art: stones
    blurb: Sometimes you name something rehash even if it isn't a rehash of anything.

      Stones are a nice picture, aren't they? I hope you agree. Hopefully this 
      fixture goes where it should.
