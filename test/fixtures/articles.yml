  blurb: |
    Random testing, also called fuzzing, is a widely-used technique for
    discovering bugs automatically. Fuzz testing programs will look for
    weaknesses by intelligently generating random inputs and executing
    the system repeatedly on those inputs.

    While quite useful for finding hard-to-reach bugs, fuzzing is only
    effective for finding certain kinds of vulnerabilities. See what kinds
    of vulnerabilities are found by fuzzers.
