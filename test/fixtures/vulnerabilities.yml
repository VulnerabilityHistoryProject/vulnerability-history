      question: |
        Please record any major events you found in the history of this
        vulnerability. Was the code rewritten at some point? Was a nearby subsystem
        changed? Did the team change?
        The event doesn't need to be directly related to this vulnerability, rather,
        we want to capture what the development team was dealing with at the time.

        There was a lot of refactoring and removing of includes in this rendering file.
        While this may not have directly contributed to adding the new buffer code,
        perhaps the buffer check for a zero-size image was overlooked due to the different
        mindset of cleaning up and moving code.  Also, some devirtualization of objects
        occurred in this refactoring period from the summer of 2013 to about the time of
        the fix.
