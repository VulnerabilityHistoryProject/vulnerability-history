# System Tests

All of these system tests are performed with the [Selenium Automated Testing Tool](https://www.selenium.dev/), using their WebDriver. It's worth a little research into how it actually works before building tests.

Additionally, there are a few pre-requisites to get going with WebDriver that I've put below.

This also assumes (at the moment), you are running the server on http://localhost:3000/. In the future, I might add this to the environnment variables, but this works for now.

## Ruby Gem

You can `gem install selenium-webdriver` easily, but we use bundler, so I've added the line `gem 'selenium-webdriver'` to our Gemfile. A quick `bundle install` should do it.

## Browser Drivers

To work with the browser itself, WebDriver must be able to interact with a driver from the browser. To make that happen, you must download and install them. More help [here](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/driver_requirements/)

### Google Chrome Driver

If you're using Google Chrome or any Chromium browser (except Edge), you can find the driver [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).

#### MacOS

On MacOS, it's better to install this through homebrew using `brew cask install chromedriver`. That's the easiest way at least. Next, to allow Mac to trust chromedriver, verify the location with `which chromedriver`, and then assuming your location is `usr/local/bin/chromedriver`, put `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/loca/bin/chromedriver`. Mac is now set up for WebDriver Testing with Chrome!

#### Windows

On Windows, I think you can just download the zip file and add the location to your PATH, but the Selenium docs would be more knowledgeable than myself.

### Safari

If you want to test on Safari, the driver is built in. You just need to enable it in the terminal with `safaridriver --enable`.
