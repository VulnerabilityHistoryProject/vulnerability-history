# Getting Set Up

* Create a secrets.yml based on secrets.default.yml.
* Get PostgreSQL and set up a user locally and put that in secret.yml

```
  $ bundle install
  $ rails db:setup
  $ rails data:chromium
  $ rails server
```

# Finding useful commands

To find out useful commands for working with data:

`$ rails -T`

# Rebuild the database

If `db/schema.rb` has changed recently, you'll need to rebuild the database:

`$ rails schema:load`

# Reload the production data

To load the production data from Chromium:

`$ rails data:chromium`

To skip the clone from github,

`$ rails data:chromium:nogit`
